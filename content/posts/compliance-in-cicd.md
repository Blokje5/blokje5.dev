title: "Building in compliance in your CI/CD pipeline with conftest"
tags: ["conftest", "open-policy-agent", "tekton"]
abstract: "In the previous post I introduced the Open Policy Agent as a method to validate configuration changes against policies to maintain compliance in your environment. In this post I will show how you can utilise the Open Policy Agent with conftest to build in compliance checks in your CI/CD pipeline and how conftest can be used to centrally manage the Rego policies."
