abstract: "Keeping up with the latest and greatest in the software industry requires a constantly changing development environment. Keeping your local machine clean is hard if you constantly install new tools. And what if you need multiple versions of the same tool installed? With Visual Studio Code Dev Containers you can dockerize your development environment to ensure that for each project you can use a clean environment!"
